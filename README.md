### Why I Chose This Course
[I chose the course because I am i need to create a demo app for the purposes of attracting co-founders and raise capital for my startup.  In lieu of having a co-founder who can create the app or hire either a consultant, employee or intern to do it for me, as a founder and entrepreneur, I must do this myself if I wish to move forward with my startup.]
